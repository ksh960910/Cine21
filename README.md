Crawling all the actors by ranking and their details & update into MongoDB

1. Crawl all the actors by ranking in http://www.cine21.com/rank
2. Also crawl details about actors. They all have different detail fields, so it's better to use NoSQL rather than SQL
3. Create JSON keys for MongoDB and insert crawled datas using pymongo library
